ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pkkudo

- Network engineer learning to code and write scripts
- Self-learner with interest in IaC, DevOps, and running open source softwares, playing with homelab running Kubernetes cluster and docker containers
    - Part of my latest homelab setup available in <https://github.com/pkkudo/homelab-v3> its document here <https://beryl.blink-1x52.net/homelab-v3/1741076584-building-high-availability-kubernetes-cluster-with-ansible/>
    - services running on my homelab
        - dns, reverse proxy, image registry, VCS, CI/CD runner, ldap, keepalived, jupyter notebook, open-webui, letta, mcpo/mcp tools, ...
    - kubernetes cluster config
        - fluxcd & self-hosted VCS, cilium, longhorn, minio, prometheus, loki, bytebase, postgres, mongodb, ...
- Personal notes generated using MkDocs, [beryl](https://beryl.blink-1x52.net/), and specifically on [my homelab here](https://beryl.blink-1x52.net/homelab/), and [building k8s cluster series here](https://beryl.blink-1x52.net/homelab/building-homelab-cluster-part-1/)
- Public articles in Japanese available at [pkkudo@zenn.dev](https://zenn.dev/pkkudo)
    - [ja] an article series on settings up Kubernetes + GitLab + Flux GitOps [here](https://zenn.dev/pkkudo/articles/39085bca8a0f85)
    - [ja] an article series on home lab using Docker [here](https://zenn.dev/pkkudo/articles/0e6c2a989bb98e) (NGINX as reverse proxy, unbound for DNS, GitLab, and etc.)

My main VCS is on self-managed, private GitLab and Gitea, and I use GitHub to add public repositories to share scripts with my engineer buddies, and to manage articles and books on Zenn.
